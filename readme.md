# dsa-queue-simulator
DSA assignment

This is a C-based traffic junction simulator using queues and SDL2 for visualization. 
This project is part of a DSA assignment to implement queue-based traffic management.
It simulates traffic movement at a four-way junction, managing vehicles with normal and priority queues.
The traffic generator program creates vehicles, and the simulator processes them based on queue rules.
